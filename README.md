DDT: Database of dynamics trajectories

We will establish a website that contains videos of representative trajectories for a variety of organic reactions. We will focus on reactions taught in undergraduate organic chemistry courses. The goal is to provide instructors with videos they can show students of molecules vibrating in meaningful ways while reacting. 

This will be a long term project involving undergrads/new grads who are interested in dynamics project.

This repository stores the tutorial and code for the website.
